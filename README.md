**Fract-ol**
================

A 42-style program that visualizes mathematical concepts using graphics.

Project Description
-----------------------

This project is an implementation of the iconic Fract-ol program, which generates fractals and other mathematical shapes using graphical rendering. The code uses the MLXLib library to create interactive visualizations.

Features
------------

* Mandelbrot Sets [1]: Unveil mesmerizing shapes created through iterative calculations.
* Julia Sets [2]: Explore intricate patterns generated by these mathematical formulas.
* Burning Ship [3]: A unique fractal that combines elements of both Julia and Mandelbrot sets.


Requirements
---------------

To compile and run the code, you'll need:

* C compiler (GCC or Clang)
* MLXLib library
* X Window System (for graphical rendering)

Compilation Instructions
---------------------------

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mohamad-Al-Nakib/Fract-ol.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Fract-ol`
3. Compile the code using the following command: `make`
4. Run : `./fractol (Choose The Fractal by Name or Number)`
